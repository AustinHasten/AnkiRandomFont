In your card layout, make sure the name of the language is a class on the item you would like the font to be randomized on. 

- i.e. {{Expression}} would become \<span class="Japanese"\>{{Expression}}\</span\>

Then go to Tools > Configure Random Fonts

- In the Search tab, enter all of the criteria you want the card to have to meet before it will have the fonts randomized. You can preview the search to make sure you're getting the cards you expect to be.

- In the Configure Fonts tab, enable/disable the fonts that you want the randomizer to choose from for each language.

- Save, enjoy.
